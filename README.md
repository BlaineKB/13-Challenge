# 13-Challenge-Ecommerce-Back-End

## Description
A backend application that uses routes, models, and seed data for an e-commerce website. The technologies used in the application were Express.js, MySQL,
Sequelize, and Insomnia for testing.

## Usage
At the root directory of the project the user runs "npm init" and "npm i" in the terminal to initialize and install the required packages. Then the user must create the database by logging in to the MySQL shell with their MySQL credentials and entering "source db/schema.sql" into that shell. After the database has been created, the user can exit the MySQL shell and navigate back to the root directory in the terminal. The tables can then be seeded with "npm run seed" in that powershell and the server started with "npm run start".
